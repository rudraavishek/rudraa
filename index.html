			<p> <b>Welcome</b> to my homepage! I am a Kolkatan currently living and working in Cambridge, UK.
			</p>
			
			<p> I am a Geochemist striving to understand planetary processes through experiments and codes. I use high pressure temperature
				experiments to understand chemical mass transfer between Earth's mantle and surface. This includes cycling of volatile elements (H, C, N, S, F and noble gases) and
				oxidized basaltic component between the mantle and exosphere and how these fluxes have evolved over geologic time. I employ variety of state-of-the-art analytical tools such 
				as Electron Microprobe, XANES, Mössbuaer spectroscopy, Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry in my research. Recently I have been involved in working
				with natural samples from Iceland to understand Carbon and Nitrogen cycling into the mantle by subduction processes.
