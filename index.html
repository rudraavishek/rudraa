			<p> Welcome to my homepage! I am a Kolkatan currently living and working in Cambridge, UK.
			</p>
			
			<p> I am a Geochemist striving to understand planetary processes through experiments and codes. I use high pressure temperature
				experiments to understand chemical mass transfer between Earth's mantle and the surface. These include cycle of volatile elements (H, C, N, S, F and noble gases)
				oxidized basaltic component from the mantle and how these fluxes have evolved over geologic time. I employ variety of state-of-the-art analytical tools such 
				as Electron Microprobe, X-ray abosorption Near Edge Spectroscopy, Mossbuaer spectroscopy, Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry in my research. Recently I have been involved in working
				with natural samples from Iceland to understand carbon and Nitrogen cycling into the mantle through subduction processes.
